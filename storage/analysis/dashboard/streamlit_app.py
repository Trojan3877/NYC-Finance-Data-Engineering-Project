Purpose:
This optional Streamlit dashboard allows viewers to interactively explore NYC payroll data using visual filters and charts. It simulates a real-time reporting interface, useful in production environments for monitoring and transparency.

Key Features:
- Reads cleaned payroll data from CSV or SQLite
- Filters by agency, year, or other parameters
- Displays charts (bar graphs, line charts, key metrics)
- Fully customizable UI using Streamlit widgets

Why This Matters:
Dashboards demonstrate full-stack thinking and the ability to present data dynamically. Even if deployed locally or not at all, this file showcases your skill in end-to-end data product development â€” a highly valued asset in internships and technical interviews.
