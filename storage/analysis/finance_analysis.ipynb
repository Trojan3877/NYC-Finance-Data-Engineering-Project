# finance_analysis.ipynb

### Purpose:
This notebook explores and visualizes NYC payroll spending trends using the cleaned dataset. It serves as the 'Insight & Analytics' layer of the pipeline.

### Key Tasks:
- Load processed payroll data (from CSV or SQLite)
- Explore high-level metrics (total spend, agencies, top-paid)
- Visualize trends (e.g., agency spend, year-over-year changes)
- Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to generate recruiter-friendly graphs

### Why This Matters:
Analysis notebooks demonstrate the ability to draw actionable insights from large datasets â€” a core expectation in Big Tech and Data Engineering roles. Clear, annotated charts highlight your ability to communicate data clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
